# Pitchfork

Pitchfork lifts Zipkin tracing data into Haystack.

## Overview

[Haystack](https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/haystack) is an [Expedia](https://www.expedia.com/)-backed project to facilitate detection and remediation of problems with enterprise-level web services and websites. Much like [Zipkin](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin), its primary goal is to provide an easy to use UI to analyse distributed tracing data, but it offers other features like trend analysis or adaptive alerting.

[Zipkin](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin) is the de facto standard for distributed tracing. We understand that migrating to a new system can be difficult and you may want to go back. Pitchfork can help you with this.

### How to build and run Pitchfork

#### Build

To build Pitchfork you need to have Java 11+ and Docker installed. Maven is optional as you can use the Maven Wrapper. 

To compile and run unit tests (Linux or Mac):

    ./mvnw clean verify
    
or (Windows):

    ./mvnw.cmd clean verify

To package:

    ./mvnw clean install
    
To build a Docker image named `hotelsdotcom/pitchfork`:

    docker build -t hotelsdotcom/pitchfork .
    
#### Running Pitchfork

The preferred way to run Pitchfork is via [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/hotelsdotcom/pitchfork/).

    docker run -p 9411:9411 hotelsdotcom/pitchfork:latest
    
You can override the default properties by with environment variables (macro case or screaming upper case), for example:

    docker run -p 9411:9411 -e PITCHFORK_FORWARDERS_HAYSTACK_ENABLED=false hotelsdotcom/pitchfork:latest

You can also run it as a normal Java application:

    java -jar pitchfork.jar
    
Or as a Spring Boot application:

    mvn spring-boot:run

###### Testing with Docker Compose

For convenience, you can use the following yaml to start pitchfork with docker-compose which starts both Pitchfork and Zipkin.
Pitchfork is configured to log the spans received and to forward them to Zipkin.
You can submit your spans to Pitchfork running on port 9411, and see them using Zipkin's web UI on port 9412.   

```yaml
version: "3"

services:

  pitchfork:
    image: hotelsdotcom/pitchfork:latest
    ports:
      - "9411:9411"
    environment:
      PITCHFORK_FORWARDERS_LOGGING_ENABLED: "true"
      PITCHFORK_FORWARDERS_LOGGING_LOG_FULL_SPAN: "true"
      PITCHFORK_FORWARDERS_ZIPKIN_HTTP_ENABLED: "true"
      PITCHFORK_FORWARDERS_ZIPKIN_HTTP_ENDPOINT: "http://zipkin:9411/api/v2/spans"
      
  zipkin:
    image: openzipkin/zipkin:latest
    ports:
      - "9412:9411"
```
    
##### Health check

The service exposes the following endpoints that can be used to test the app's health and to retrieve useful info:

Endpoint      | Description
--------------|------------
`/health`     | Shows application health information.
`/info`       | Displays application info.
`/metrics`    | Metrics endpoint that can be used to examine metrics collected by the application.
`/prometheus` | Endpoint that presents metrics in a format that can be scraped by Prometheus.

## Architecture

Pitchfork acts as a collector and forwarder of tracing data.
If you are currently using Zipkin you don't need to do code changes to your service. You can simply change your exporter to use a new endpoint and report the traces to Pitchfork instead of Zipkin.
Pitchfork accepts Zipkin spans in json v1 and v2, thrift and protobuf. You can also configure this application to consume Zipkin spans from a Kafka broker.

Pitchfork can be configured to forward incoming spans to: a Zipkin collector; Haystack (using Kafka or Kinesis as a message bus); a logger that just prints the traces as they are received.


    [ Service A ] ------                               ------> [ Haystack / Kafka ]
                         \                            /
                          ------> [ Pitchfork ] ------
                         /                            \
    [ Service B ] ------                               ------> [ Zipkin ]

These different forwarders can be enabled/disabled separately. Please see the application.yml file for a list of the different configurations available for each, or refer to the table above with the list of properties you can configure. 

## Use Cases

* [Hotels.com](https://www.hotels.com/) - Microservices architecture using stock Zipkin data and libraries ([Spring Cloud Sleuth](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth/), [Brave](https://github.com/openzipkin/brave), etc.) that report to Pitchfork which handles the integration with [Haystack](https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/haystack). 

## Contributing

None of these are essential for a pull request to be approved but they all help.

* We don't formalize coding standards for this project other than using spaces and not tabs (we're not animals). Please try to use the existing code as a convention guide.
* Make sure you test your code before opening a new pr. You will need Java 11+ and Docker to run the integration tests. Note that some classes in this project do not have unit tests: this is because either they are not trivial to test or having test coverage at this level would not add much.
* Try to have a clean git history. Use git rebase when pulling changes from master and, if you have multiple (related) commits do try and squash them into a single one.
